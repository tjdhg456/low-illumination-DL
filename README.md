# Low-Illumination-Detector
- Object Detection in the Dark (YoLo, SSD-based)
- Robustness for Low-illumination Environments


### TODO
- [x] Set the Dataset and DataLoader (LOL dataset, COCO, ExDark)
- [x] Split the Backbone into two-parts (robust-extractor / detector)
- [ ] Patch Selection Strategy from CUT (Contrastive Unpaired Translation) 
- [ ] Set the SSD and YoLo Detector
- [ ] Training Schemes for 1) Learn Robustness for Extractor, 2) Learn to Detect
